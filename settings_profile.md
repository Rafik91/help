### Managing Your Profile

You can set various preferences in your profile. 

You can choose a light (default) or dark display theme and set your default dashboard.

[Query Builder](https://docs.wavefront.com/query_language_query_builder.html) preferences allow you to choose whether to enable Query Builder and whether to always display the Query Builder when you navigate to a blank chart or new alert.

You can view [permissions](https://docs.wavefront.com/permissions_overview.html) you've been granted and 
generate and revoke tokens required for accessing the [Wavefront API](https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_api.html).
