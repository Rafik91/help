## What is an Maintenance Window? 

A maintenance window is a predetermined time window when preventative maintenance or testing may occur. Typically,
maintenance windows are used when disruptive operations could occur as a result of system maintenance and/or testing.
These disruptive operations create a high likelihood of causing Wavefront alerts to fire. A maintenance window
allows you to notify Wavefront when maintenance will occur and which subset of alerts or sources will be affected.

Maintenance windows support various operations. You can edit and delete maintenance windows and you can
extend the end time by various increments.
