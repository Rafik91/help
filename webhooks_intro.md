##What is a Webhook? 

A webhook is a user-defined HTTP callback. A webhook is usually triggered when a particular event occurs at the source
site. When the event occurs, the source site makes an HTTP POST request to the URL configured for the webhook that
contains data either passed as simple POST keys and values or in some other format such as JSON.

Webhooks allow you to integrate actions with alerts.

While any Wavefront user can view webhooks, you must have the appropriate [permission](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1090) to create, update,
or delete a webhook.
