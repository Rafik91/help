## Understanding Slow Queries

Jump to Slow Query Dashboard Sections - Several slow queries being executed within the selected time window can cause
the Slow Query Dashboard page to be very long. These section links allow you to jump down to the relevant section of
your choice. The links display only after you have scrolled down the page.

General Information - Provides general information about slow queries in the system. You can quickly see which slow
queries failed to complete vs. which queries took a long time but eventually completed. It also provides you with the
number of slow queries by user(s).

Time Windows - Allow you to look at slow queries executed within the selected time windows.
