### Adding an Amazon Cloud Integration

Adding an Amazon cloud integration requires establishing a trust relationship between Amazon and Wavefront by sharing account IDs and an external ID. The external ID can be generated by Wavefront or by your company. To use an ID generated by Wavefront, click **Set up Amazon Account** to configure all integrations&mdash;CloudWatch, Cloudtrail, and AWS Metrics+&mdash;at once. To use an ID generated by your company, set up each integration individually.

You start by granting Wavefront read-only access to your Amazon account or by giving Wavefront the permissions listed in [AWS Metrics Integration](https://docs.wavefront.com/integrations_aws_metrics.html).
