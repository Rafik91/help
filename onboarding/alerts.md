Wavefront alerts get you on top of issues emerging across all your distributed applications. Intelligent alerting helps DevOps and developer teams avoid alert fatigue by increasing accuracy of incident detection.

<td style="text-align: left;vertical-align: top">Craft intelligent alerts using:
<ul>
<li>Over a hundred functions help you design the [perfect alert](/dashboard/demo-the-perfect-alert) for any anomaly.</li>
<li>Backtest on existing data so you can see when the alert would have fired in the past.</li>
<li>Deactivation via maintenance windows or snoozing.
</ul>

Ultimately you experience fewer false alarms and are better able to predict the behavior of your applications and environments.

Send notification of alert state changes to any number of channels:
<ul>
<li>email</li>
<li>PagerDuty and VictorOps</li>
<li>HipChat and Slack</li>
<li>custom webhooks</li>
</ul>
