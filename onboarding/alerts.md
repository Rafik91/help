<td style="text-align: left;vertical-align: top">Wavefront alerts get you on top of issues emerging across all your distributed applications. Intelligent alerting and accurate incident detection helps DevOps and developer teams avoid alert fatigue.<br /><br />

Craft intelligent alerts:
<ul>
<li>Over a hundred functions help you design the [perfect alert](/dashboard/demo-the-perfect-alert) for any anomaly.</li>
<li>Backtesting existing data lets you see when the alert would have fired in the past.</li>
<li>Deactivating to avoid wasting time on sidelined systems.
</ul>

Ultimately you experience fewer false alarms and are better able to predict the behavior of your applications and environments.<br /><br />

Send notification of alert state changes to any channel:
<ul>
<li>PagerDuty and VictorOps</li>
<li>HipChat and Slack</li>
<li>Custom webhooks</li>
</ul>
