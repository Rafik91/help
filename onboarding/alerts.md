<td style="text-align: left;vertical-align: top">Wavefront allows you to craft intelligent alerts tailored to your data:
<ul>
<li>Over a hundred functions help you design the perfect alert for any anomaly.</li>
<li>Backtest on existing data so you can see when the alert would have fired in the past.</li>
<li>Deactivate alerts using maintenance windows or snoozing.
</ul>

Ultimately you experience fewer false alarms and are better able to predict the behavior of your applications and environments.

You can send notification of alert state changes to any number of channels:
<ul>
<li>email</li>
<li>PagerDuty and VictorOps</li>
<li>HipChat and Slack</li>
<li>custom webhooks</li>
</ul>
