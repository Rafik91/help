Wavefront's charts and dashboards enable the real-time insight that helps you perform meaningful analysis and make data-driven decisions. In addition to displaying your data in standard line, point, and stacked area charts, you can

- Explore correlations with scatter plots
- Highlight critical metrics with sparklines
- Use Markdown charts to integrate operational analysis and run book procedures

Both charts and dashboards support:

- Time scale quick select and zoom in and out
- Isolating sources and series
- Displaying events

To get you started, Wavefront includes pre-built charts and dashboards for Amazon Web Services, container technologies, and standard collector agents.
