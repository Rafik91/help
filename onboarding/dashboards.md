Wavefront's dashboards enable the real-time insight that helps you perform meaningful analysis and make data-driven decisions. To get you started, Wavefront has sample dashboards for many problem domains, including Amazon Web Services and container technologies. Dashboards support a myriad of controls for exploring different time scales, focussing on individual charts, and sharing. Support for in-place Markdown format documentation enables integration between operational analysis and run book procedures. Wavefront offers multiple tools for customizing dashboards including UI-based drag and drop editing and a text-based JSON editor. Wavefront dashboards support full change tracking, version management, and direct cloning.
