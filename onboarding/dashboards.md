Wavefront's charts and dashboards enable the real-time insight that helps you perform meaningful analysis and make data-driven decisions. To get you started, Wavefront has sample dashboards for Amazon Web Services, container technologies, and standard collector agents. Charts and dashboards support exploring time scales, sharing live and historical data, isolating data streams from sources, and more. 

In addition to standard line, point, stacked area charts, you can explore correlations with scatter plots, highlight critical metrics with sparklines and use Markdown charts to integrate operational analysis and run book procedures. Wavefront dashboards support full change tracking, version management, and direct cloning.
