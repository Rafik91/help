## Adding a Cloud Integration

Adding a cloud integration involves sharing account IDs and an external ID which establishes a trust relationship
between Amazon and Wavefront.

The external ID can be generated by Wavefront or by your company. If you use an ID generated by Wavefront you
can set up all integrations -- CloudWatch, Cloudtrail, and EC2 -- at once. If you want to use an ID generated by
your company, you must set up each integration individually. In summary, the integration options are:

- **Set up Amazon Account** - Integrate CloudWatch, Cloudtrail, and EC2 data at the same time. Choose if:
    - You are an administrator for your AWS account.
    - You can use an external ID generated by Wavefront.
    - You want Wavefront to automatically install AWS dashboards.
- **Register [CloudWatch | CloudTrail | EC2]** - Integrate each type of data individually. Choose if:
    - You are not an administrator for your AWS account, but will be gathering required information from an administrator.
    - You want to use an external ID generated by your company.
    - You prefer to manually install AWS dashboards.

Regardless of the integration type you choose, you must first grant Wavefront read-only access to your Amazon account.
You run the Amazon Create New Role wizard where you provide Wavefront account and external IDs. In the Amazon Create New Role wizard Review screen, copy the Role ARN containing the Amazon account ID for use in Wavefront cloud integrations.
