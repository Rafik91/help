## Adding a Cloud Integration

Adding a cloud integration involves setting up a trust between relationship between Amazon and Wavefront.
The mechanism to establish trust between Wavefront and AWS requires sharing account IDs and an external ID between the two services.

The external ID can be generated by Wavefront or by your company. The source of the external ID affects how you set up the
integration. If you use an external ID generated by Wavefront you can set up all integrations at once. If you want
to use an external ID generated by your company, you must set up each integration individually. In summary, the integration options are:

- Set up Amazon Account - Integrate CloudWatch, Cloudtrail, and EC2 data at the same time. Choose this option if:
    - You are an administrator for your AWS account.
    - You can use an external ID generated by Wavefront.
    - You want Wavefront to automatically install AWS dashboards.
- Register [CloudWatch | CloudTrail | EC2] - Integrate each type of data individually. Choose this option if:
    - You are not an administrator for your AWS account, but will be gathering required information from an administrator.
    - You want to use an external ID generated by your company.
    - You prefer to manually install AWS dashboards. For more information, contact [support](mailto:support@wavefront.com).

## Granting Wavefront Read-only Access to your Amazon Account

Regardless of the integration type you choose, you must first grant Wavefront read-only access to your Amazon account.
You run the Amazon Create New Role wizard where you provide Wavefront account and external IDs. In the Amazon Create New Role wizard Review screen, copy the Role ARN for use in Wavefront cloud integrations.
