### Adding a Cloud Integration

Adding a cloud integration requires establishing a trust relationship between Amazon and Wavefront by sharing account IDs and an external ID. The external ID can be generated by Wavefront or by your company. If you use an ID generated by Wavefront you can set up all integrations&mdash;CloudWatch, Cloudtrail, and EC2&mdash;at once. If you want to use an ID generated by your company, you set up each integration individually. Choose:

- **Set up Amazon Account** to integrate CloudWatch, Cloudtrail, and EC2 data at the same time if you can use an external ID generated by Wavefront and you want Wavefront to automatically install AWS dashboards.
- **Register [CloudWatch | CloudTrail | EC2]** to integrate each type of data individually if you want to use an external ID generated by your company and you prefer to manually install AWS dashboards.

For all integration types you first grant Wavefront read-only access to your Amazon account. Run the Amazon Create New Role wizard where you provide Wavefront account and external IDs. In the Create New Role wizard Review, copy the Role ARN containing the Amazon account ID for use in Wavefront cloud integrations.
