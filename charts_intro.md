### What is a Chart?

[Charts](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1064) are the primary way you view the status of your metrics. You add
[Wavefront Query Language](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1019) queries to view and perform operations on metrics and configure [chart options](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1158) for the most helpful presentation.

### Interacting with Charts and Dashboards

Wavefront provides many ways to [interact with charts and dashboards](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1067).
You can change time windows, share links, apply queries, isolate sources, and zoom in and out. In charts you can isolate
individual series and use hot keys to see full precision values and fish-eye views at the cursor.
