## Creating an Alert

Alerts have conditions and targets.

You define conditions using [ts() query]() expressions, which is the same language you
use to build your charts.

You can avoid false positives by using the Backtesting option in Events Display.

[Creating an Alert](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1050) gives info on all alert options.

### Targets

Targets can be email addresses, PagerDuty and VictorOps, as well as arbitrary webhooks. See how to integrate your alerts with these targets:

- [HipChat Rooms](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1055)
- [PagerDuty](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1056)
- [Slack Channels](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1183)
- [VictorOps](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1251)
- [Webhooks](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1054)
