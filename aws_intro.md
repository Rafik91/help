##What is a Cloud Integration?

Wavefront supports cloud integrations, a mechanism that allows you to ingest metrics directly without needing to send them to a Wavefront proxy.
The [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com) (AWS) cloud integration is the quickest and easiest way to get 
your [CloudWatch](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch) and[CloudTrail](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail) data into Wavefront.

While any Wavefront user can view integrations, you must have the appropriate
[permission](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1090) to create, update, or delete an integration.

Wavefront supports three types of AWS cloud integrations:

-   **CloudWatch** - Retrieves AWS metric and dimension data using the AWS CloudWatch API.
-   **CloudTrail** - Retrieves EC2 event information stored in JSON-formatted log files in an AWS S3 bucket.
-   **EC2** - Retrieves metrics from AWS APIs other than CloudWatch.

The mechanism to establish trust between Wavefront and AWS requires sharing an **external ID** between the two services.
The external ID can be generated by Wavefront or by your company. The source of the external ID affects how you set up
the integration. If you use an external ID generated by Wavefront you can set up all integration types at once. If you
want to use an external ID generated by your company you must set up each integration separately.
