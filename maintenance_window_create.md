## Creating a Maintenance Window

When you create a maintenance window you specify when the window begins and ends and the alerts and
sources to suppress during the maintenance window.

You identify the alerts that are affected using alert tags and the sources using source names and
source tags. Since tags can apply to multiple alerts and sources, it is easy to suppress multiple alerts and sources with one maintenance window. You must configure at least one alert tag, source, or source tag.
