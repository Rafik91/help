### What is an Alert?

An alert is triggered when a monitored metric reaches a value that indicates a problem. When an alert triggers, notifications are sent to targets such as email addresses, pager services, and real-time communication channels.

To disable alert checking for a set of sources during a specific time window you can put them in a [maintenance window](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1053#jive_content_id_Creating_a_Maintenance_Window).
Snoozing alerts disables alert checking for a fixed time window.
