### What is an Alert?

An alert focuses attention on a system component that could potentially cause service degradation or outage. An alert is triggered when a monitored metric reaches a value that indicates a problem. When an alert triggers, notifications are sent to targets such as email addresses, pager services, and real-time communication channels.

Active alerts can be in either the checking or firing states. Inactive alerts are either in maintenance, snoozed, or
invalid.

To disable alert checking for a set of sources during a specific time window you can put them in maintenance.
Alternatively snoozing alerts disables alert checking for a fixed time window.
