## What is an Alert?

An alert is a condition and set of actions that are performed when the condition evaluates to true or false for a specified period of time. You express a condition using ts() queries and operators.

You configure an alert to send notifications to targets when the alert changes state.

You can send notifications to targets such as email, PagerDuty, and VictorOps and you can also configure arbitrary actions such as invoking a webhook and running an auto-remediation script.
