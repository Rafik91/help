### What is a Metric?

A metric is a quantitative measure of a system property used to track health or performance. Wavefront supports metrics
in [Wavefront data format](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1031) as well as other standard formats such as [Graphite](http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),  [OpenTSDB](http://opentsdb.net/docs/build/html/user_guide/writing.html), and those generated by cloud-based services
such as [AWS](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1032).

Once metrics are ingested into Wavefront you can [query](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1019) and
[chart](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1158) the data to help understand underlying patterns. You can create
[alerts](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1052) to notify operators when anomalous values indicate a system malfunction.

Metrics are automatically hidden after 4 weeks of inactivity, but you can also manually hide metrics. While hidden metrics are removed from autocomplete, they can still be used in a query when data values are present.
