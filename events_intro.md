Wavefront events as originate from several different sources. Some events are generated when you perform actions in
Wavefront. For example, when you edit or snooze an alert, the source is System. When an alert fires or resolves, the
source is System/Alert. You can manually add events to identify user actions, such as code pushes, that occur outside
Wavefront but that affect metrics within Wavefront. The source of such events is User.

When an event occurs in Wavefront, such as a firing alert or the start of a maintenance window, an icon associated with
the alert displays on the X-axis of a chart. If a single event occurs in a given time interval, the event icon displays
as a dot.  The color of an event icon is associated with the severity:

- severe - <span style="color: #d9534f;">red</span>
- warn - <span style="color: #FFA320;">orange</span>
- smoke - <span style="color: #B8C8D8;">gray</span>
- info - <span style="color: #00B3CA;">blue</span>

If two or more events occur in a given time interval, the event icon displays as an asterisk <span class="fa-asterisk fa"/>.
Additionally, instantaneous events include a vertical line that overlays the chart, and non-instantaneous or ongoing events include a shaded box
representing the duration of the event.

As your use of alerts, events, and maintenance windows grows, so too will the number of event icons that are displayed.
While Wavefront provides users with the ability to control these displays at the individual chart level (local), we also
provide the ability to control the displays at the dashboard level (global). The dashboard Show Events dropdown allows
you to control when event icons are displayed on every chart in a dashboard:

- **In Chart Queries** - Displays events based on the selection at the individual chart level. Default setting.
- **In Dashboard Prefs** - Displays the events defined by the global event() expression set in dashboard preferences.
- **In Chart & Dashboard** - Displays the set of events from chart queries and the global dashboard expression.
- **Related Alerts** - Displays events generated by an alert based on a single source or set of sources.
- **All** - Displays all events that have occurred within the time window associated with the chart windows.
- **None** - Hides all events from every chart associated with the dashboard.

While every user can access the Events page and view event overlays on charts, you must have Event Management permission
to perform create, delete, and close and event.
