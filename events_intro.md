Wavefront events as originate from several different sources. Some events are generated when you perform actions in
Wavefront. For example, when you edit or snooze an alert, the source is **System**. When an alert fires or resolves, the
source is **System/Alert**. You can manually add events to identify user actions, such as code pushes, that occur outside
Wavefront but that affect metrics within Wavefront. The source of such events is **User**.

When an event occurs in Wavefront, such as a firing alert or the start of a maintenance window, an icon associated with
the alert displays on the X-axis of a chart. If a single event occurs in a given time interval, the event icon displays
as a dot.  The color of an event icon is associated with the severity:

- severe - <span style="color: #d9534f;">red</span>
- warn - <span style="color: #FFA320;">orange</span>
- smoke - <span style="color: #B8C8D8;">gray</span>
- info - <span style="color: #00B3CA;">blue</span>

If two or more events occur in a given time interval, the event icon displays as an asterisk "\*". Additionally, instantaneous events include a vertical line that overlays the chart, and non-instantaneous or ongoing events include a shaded box representing the duration of the event.

You control event displays at the chart level (local) by adding events() queries to the chart.
You can also control the displays at the dashboard level (global). To control when event icons are displayed on every chart in a dashboard, select **Show Events >**:

<dl>
<dt>In Chart Queries</dt><dd>Displays events based on the selection at the individual chart level. Default setting.</dd>
<dt>In Dashboard Prefs</dt><dd>Displays the events defined by the global events() expression set in [dashboard preferences](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1068#jive_content_id_Setting_Dashboard_Preferences).</dd>
<dt>In Chart & Dashboard</dt><dd>Displays the set of events from chart events() and global events() expressions.</dd>
<dt>Related Alerts</dt><dd>Displays events generated by an alert based on a single source or set of sources.</dd>
<dt>All</dt><dd>Displays all events that have occurred within the time window associated with the chart windows.</dd>
<dt>None</dt><dd>Hides all events from every chart in the dashboard.</dd></dl>

While any Wavefront user can an access the Events page and view event overlays on charts, you must have the appropriate [permission](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1090) to create, delete, and close an event.
