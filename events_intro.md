Events originate from several different sources. Some events are generated when you perform actions in Wavefront. For
example, when you edit or snooze an alert, the event source is **System**. When an alert fires or resolves, the source
is **System/Alert**.

You can manually add **User** events to identify user actions, such as code pushes, that occur outside Wavefront but
that affect metrics within Wavefront. User events support various operations. You can edit and delete all user events
and you can close (end) user events that are ongoing (whether they have no end time or a specific end time).

While any Wavefront user can an access the Events page and view event overlays on charts, you must have the appropriate
[permission](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1090) to create, delete, or close an event.

### Displaying Events in Charts

Icons associated with events can be displayed on the X-axis of a chart. If a single event occurs in a given time
interval,  the event icon displays as a dot. If two or more events occur in a given time interval, the event icon
displays as an asterisk <i class="fa fa-asterisk"></i>.  The color of an event icon is associated with the severity:

- SEVERE - <span style="color: #d9534f;">red</span>
- WARN - <span style="color: #FFA320;">orange</span>
- SMOKE - <span style="color: #B8C8D8;">gray</span>
- INFO - <span style="color: #00B3CA;">blue</span>

Instantaneous events display a vertical line that overlays the chart; non-instantaneous or ongoing events display a
shaded box representing the duration of the event.

You control event displays at the chart level (local) by adding events() queries to a chart. You can also control the
displays at the dashboard level (global). To control when event icons are displayed on every chart in a dashboard,
select **Show Events >**:

<dt>In Chart Queries</dt><dd>Display events based on the selection at the individual chart level.</dd>
<dt>In Dashboard Prefs</dt><dd>Display the events defined by the global events() expression set in [dashboard preferences](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1068#jive_content_id_Setting_Dashboard_Preferences).</dd>
