Wavefront events as originate from several different sources. Some events are generated when you perform actions in
Wavefront. For example, when you edit or snooze an alert, the source is *System*. When an alert fires or resolves, the
source is *System/Alert*. You can manually add events to identify user actions, such as code pushes, that occur outside
Wavefront but that affect metrics within Wavefront. The source of such events is *User*.

When an event occurs in Wavefront, such as a firing alert or the start of a maintenance window, an icon associated with
the alert displays on the X-axis of a chart. If a single event occurs in a given time interval, the event icon displays
as a dot.  The color of an event icon is associated with the severity:

- severe - <span style="color: #d9534f;">red</span>
- warn - <span style="color: #FFA320;">orange</span>
- smoke - <span style="color: #B8C8D8;">gray</span>
- info - <span style="color: #00B3CA;">blue</span>

If two or more events occur in a given time interval, the event icon displays as an asterisk <span class="fa-asterisk fa"/>.
Additionally, instantaneous events include a vertical line that overlays the chart, and non-instantaneous or ongoing events include a shaded box representing the duration of the event.

You control event displays at the chart level (local) by adding [events() queries](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1157) to the chart.
You can also control the displays at the dashboard level (global). To control when event icons are displayed on every chart in a dashboard,
select **Show Events >** and one of the following:

- **In Chart Queries** - Displays events based on the selection at the individual chart level. Default setting.
- **In Dashboard Prefs** - Displays the events defined by the global events() expression set in [dashboard preferences](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1068#jive_content_id_Setting_Dashboard_Preferences).
- **In Chart & Dashboard** - Displays the set of events from chart events() and global events() expressions.
- **Related Alerts** - Displays events generated by an alert based on a single source or set of sources.
- **All** - Displays all events that have occurred within the time window associated with the chart windows.
- **None** - Hides all events from every chart in the dashboard.

While any Wavefront user can an access the Events page and view event overlays on charts, you must have the appropriate [permission](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1090) to create, delete, and close an event.
