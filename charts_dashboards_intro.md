## What is a Chart?

[Charts](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1064) are the primary way you view the status of your metrics. You add
[ts() queries](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1019) to view and perform operations on metrics and configure
[chart options](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1158) for the most helpful view.

## What is a Dashboard?

Dashboards group a set of related charts. Dashboards allow you to share [display
preferences](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1068#jive_content_id_Setting_Dashboard_Preferences),
[variables](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1062), and [overlay
events](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1063) across all the charts contained in the dashboard.  Within
dashboards use can use
[sections](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1068#jive_content_id_Configuring_Dashboard_Sections) to further
organize charts.

## Interacting with Charts and Dashboards

Wavefront provides many ways to [interact with charts and dashboards](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1067).
You can change time windows, share links, apply queries, isolate sources, and zoom in and out. In charts you can isolate
individual series and use hot keys to see full precision values and fish-eye views at the cursor.
