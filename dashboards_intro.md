### What is a Dashboard?

Dashboards group a set of related [charts](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1064). All charts in a dashboard share [display
preferences](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1068#jive_content_id_Setting_Dashboard_Preferences),
[variables](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1062), and [
events](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1063). Within
dashboards you use [sections](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1068#jive_content_id_Configuring_Dashboard_Sections) to further organize charts.
