Wavefront is a high performance streaming analytics platform designed for monitoring and optimization.  The service is
unique in its ability to scale to very high data ingestion rates and query loads. The result is a technology stack
that scales horizontally while providing access to all of the granular data collected for all time.

The major components of Wavefront include the **Wavefront SaaS application**, which facilitates economies of scale for
deployment, flexibility, and time to value and the Wavefront proxy. The **Wavefront proxy** is the interface to
**collector agents**, which instrument hardware and software applications. The Wavefront application can also collect
metrics directly from external metrics services such as those provided by Amazon Web Services.
