### Setting up an Amazon Account

 If you can use an external ID generated by Wavefront and you want Wavefront to automatically install AWS dashboards, run **Set up Amazon Account** to integrate CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and EC2 data at the same time.

For all integration types you first grant Wavefront read-only access to your Amazon account. Run the Amazon Create New Role wizard where you provide Wavefront account and external IDs. In the Create New Role wizard Review, copy the Role ARN containing the Amazon account ID for use in Wavefront cloud integrations.
